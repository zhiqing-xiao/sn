We will use this unified notation throughout the book. 】 to 【 For episodic tasks, let $R_t=0$ for $t>T$. In fact, the discount factor of an episodic task can also be $<1$. Consequently, discount factor of an episodic task is usually $\gamma \in \left(0,1\right]$, while discount factor of a sequential task is usually $\gamma \in \left(0,1\right)$. We will use this unified notation throughout the book. 】(The first and last sentense remain unchanged. The middle sentense is extended. Previous statement is misleading.)
